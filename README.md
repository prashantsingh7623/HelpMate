# HelpMate
Mini Project
This is an android application which alerts the user when he enters into accident prone area.
The data (i.e., areas which are accident prone) is entered manually.
Geofence is used to monitor and bound the area.
The user will be notified as soon as he enters into any area bounded by geofence.
